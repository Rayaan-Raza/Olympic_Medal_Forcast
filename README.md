# Olympic Medal Prediction with Python

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and forecasting Olympic medal data for different countries. It explores various methods and visualizations, including:

- **Data exploration and cleaning**
- **Calculating total and gold medal counts by country over time**
- **Time series forecasting using Prophet**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `prophet`
- `scikit-learn` (optional for future implementations)
- `tensorflow` (optional for future implementations)
- `pickle`

### Download the Data

Replace the path in `df = pd.read_csv("../data/Summer-Olympic-medals-1976-to-2008.csv", encoding='ISO-8859-1')` with the actual location of your Olympic medals dataset in CSV format. It's recommended to use a dataset spanning multiple Olympics.

### Run the Script

Execute the Python script (`main.py` or your chosen filename) to generate the visualizations and perform the forecasting.

## Code Structure

- **`main.py` (or your chosen filename):** This file contains the core code for data analysis, visualization, and forecasting. You may encounter additional helper functions or scripts depending on your implementation choices.

## Functionality

The script performs the following tasks:

### Data Loading and Cleaning

- Reads the Olympic medals dataset.
- Checks for missing values and explores the data.

### Visualization

Creates charts to visualize:

- Number of gold medals won by each country over time.
- Total number of medals won by each country.

### Forecasting

- Demonstrates forecasting Olympic medals for a specific country using Facebook Prophet.
- Allows you to specify the country and year to split data into training and testing sets.
- Generates forecasts for the next several Olympics (adjustable).
- Visualizes the actual data, forecasts, and uncertainty intervals.

### Model Saving (Optional)

- Saves the trained Prophet model for potential future use (requires `pickle`).

## Customization

You can modify the script to:

- Analyze and forecast medals for different countries.
- Explore alternative forecasting methods like ARIMA or LSTMs (requires additional libraries).
- Implement functionalities for user input or interactive visualization.
